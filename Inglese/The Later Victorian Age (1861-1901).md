- **Decline of British Hegemony:** Britain's unchallenged industrial and military dominance began to decline as other powers like Germany and the United States emerged. This led to increased competition and a sense of anxiety about Britain's place in the world.
- **Rise of Socialism and Trade Unions:** The stark inequalities of the Victorian era led to the rise of socialist ideas and the growth of trade unions. Workers began to demand better working conditions and a greater share of the wealth.
- **Challenges to Religious Faith:** Scientific discoveries, particularly Darwin's theory of evolution, challenged traditional religious beliefs. This led to growing secularism and a questioning of established authority.
- **The New Imperialism:** Despite anxieties about its global standing, Britain continued to expand its empire, particularly in Africa. This "New Imperialism" was driven by a complex mix of economic, political, and ideological factors.
- **The Woman Question:** The late Victorian era saw increasing demands for women's suffrage and greater social and political rights for women. This period witnessed the emergence of the Suffragette movement, which would eventually achieve its goal of women's voting rights in the 20th century.

**In a Nutshell:**

The later years of Queen Victoria’s reign were a time of dynamism and change. It was a balancing act between holding onto Britain's powerful position while adapting to the shifting social, economic, and political realities at home and abroad.

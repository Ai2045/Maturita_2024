**Rupert Brooke (1887-1915): Early Idealism and Glory**

  
- **Context:** Brooke's early death in 1915 (from sepsis, not combat) meant he never experienced the full brutality of trench warfare that shaped Owen's poetry. His perspective reflects the initial patriotism and romanticized view of war that was prevalent at the war's outset.
- **Key Poem:** "The Soldier" (1914)
    - **Famous lines:**
        - "If I should die, think only this of me: / That there's some corner of a foreign field / That is for ever England."
        - "A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware, / Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam, / A body of England's, breathing English air."
- **His View of War:**
    - **Noble Sacrifice:** Death in battle is presented as a noble sacrifice, the ultimate act of patriotism.
    - **Idealized Vision:** The poem glorifies England, presenting death as a way to eternally bind oneself to one's homeland.
    - **Legacy and Beauty:** Even in death, the soldier leaves behind a legacy of beauty – a "corner of a foreign field" transformed into a sacred English space.

  

**Wilfred Owen (1893-1918): Brutal Reality and the Loss of Innocence**

  

- **Context:** Owen served on the Western Front and endured the horrors of trench warfare. His poetry, written from direct experience, starkly contrasts with Brooke's idealistic view.
- **Key Poems:** "Dulce et Decorum Est" (1917), "Anthem for Doomed Youth" (1917)
    - **Famous lines from "Dulce et Decorum Est":**

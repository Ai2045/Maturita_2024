**Major Themes of _1984_:**

  

- **Totalitarianism and the Abuse of Power:** The Party exercises absolute control over every aspect of life: thoughts, language, history, and even emotions.
- **Surveillance and Censorship:** Telescreens and the Thought Police create a climate of constant fear and paranoia, eliminating privacy and dissent.
- **Propaganda and Manipulation of Language:** "Newspeak" limits thought by reducing vocabulary. The Party distorts language to control how people perceive reality ("War is Peace," "Freedom is Slavery," "Ignorance is Strength").
- **Individuality vs. Conformity:** Winston's struggle highlights the dangers of blind obedience and the importance of independent thought.
- **The Power of Love and Human Connection:** His relationship with Julia represents a form of resistance against the Party's attempts to suppress human emotions.
- **The Fragility of Truth:** The Party demonstrates that with enough power, history can be rewritten and truth becomes subjective.

**Key Differences and Nuances:**

  

1. **Nationalism:** While both were fascinated by beauty and self-expression, D'Annunzio's nationalism set him apart. This nationalistic fervor ultimately led him to support Italian Fascism, a path Wilde did not share.
2. **Literary Style:** While both were masters of language, their styles differed. D'Annunzio's prose is often lush, and decadent, full of symbolism, reflecting his obsession with sensual experience. Wilde's writing, though also attentive to beauty, is sharper, wittier, full of paradoxes and social commentary. Think of the biting satire in "The Importance of Being Earnest" – that's distinctly Wilde.
3. **Portrayal of Women**: While both could be accused of portraying women as objects of desire at times, Wilde's female characters, like Gwendolen Fairfax in "Earnest," often possess agency and wit, challenging societal expectations.
